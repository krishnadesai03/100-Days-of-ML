# ðŸ§  Day 1 â€” Introduction to Machine Learning

## What is Machine Learning (ML)?
Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables computers to learn from data and improve their performance over time **without being explicitly programmed**.  
Instead of writing step-by-step instructions, we feed the machine data and allow it to find patterns, make predictions, or take decisions on its own.

## ðŸ§© Traditional Programming vs Machine Learning

| Aspect | Traditional Programming | Machine Learning |
|--------|-------------------------|------------------|
| **Approach** | You give the computer rules (logic) and data, it gives output. | You give the computer data and output, it learns the rules (model). |
| **Dependency** | Relies on explicit human-coded instructions. | Relies on learning patterns from data. |
| **Adaptability** | Struggles with new or unseen data. | Adapts and improves as more data is provided. |
| **Examples** | Calculator, sorting algorithms, billing systems. | Spam detection, recommendation systems, self-driving cars. |

## ðŸ’¡ Why ML is Better Than Traditional Programming
- It **automates pattern discovery** and decision-making without human intervention.  
- It can **handle complex and high-dimensional data** thatâ€™s impractical to hard-code.  
- It **improves with experience** â€” more data leads to better accuracy.  
- It enables **intelligent applications** like speech recognition, predictive analytics, and personalized recommendations.
