# ü§ñ Day 2 ‚Äî Understanding AI, ML, and DL

## What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the broad field of computer science focused on **building systems that can perform tasks requiring human intelligence**, such as reasoning, learning, perception, and decision-making.  
**Examples:** Chatbots, game-playing bots, self-driving cars, and smart assistants like Alexa or Siri.

## üß† What is Machine Learning (ML)?
Machine Learning (ML) is a **subset of AI** that enables systems to **learn from data** instead of following fixed, rule-based logic.  
ML algorithms identify patterns and make predictions or decisions based on experience.  
**Examples:** Spam detection, recommendation systems, and credit-risk prediction.

---

## üß¨ What is Deep Learning (DL)?
Deep Learning (DL) is a **subset of ML** that uses **artificial neural networks** with multiple layers (‚Äúdeep‚Äù architectures) to automatically learn complex patterns from large datasets.  
It is especially powerful for processing **unstructured data** like images, audio, and text.  
**Examples:** Image classification, speech recognition, and language translation.

## ‚öôÔ∏è AI vs ML vs DL ‚Äî Key Differences

| Aspect | Artificial Intelligence (AI) | Machine Learning (ML) | Deep Learning (DL) |
|--------|-------------------------------|------------------------|--------------------|
| **Definition** | The science of making machines smart and capable of human-like tasks. | A subset of AI that learns from data to make predictions or decisions. | A subset of ML using neural networks to learn complex representations. |
| **Data Requirement** | Can work with smaller data sets using rules. | Needs structured data for training. | Requires large amounts of labeled/unstructured data. |
| **Human Intervention** | Often requires manual rule creation. | Learns patterns automatically but may need feature engineering. | Learns features automatically with minimal human input. |
| **Computation** | Moderate | High | Very High (requires GPUs/TPUs) |
| **Examples** | Chatbots, expert systems, robots | Fraud detection, recommendation engines | Image recognition, voice assistants, NLP models |
